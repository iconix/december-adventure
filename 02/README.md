## adventure 02: add element (acceleration) from _the nature of code_ chapter 1 to my echosystem

- today, i am continuing with my 'ec(h)osystem' project started for a recurse center book club (w1'24 batch)
- the 'ecosystem project' from _the nature of code_ book involves creating a simulation of a digital ecosystem where computational creatures interact in a virtual environment. the project encourages students to apply various concepts learned throughout the book to develop a complex, interactive system - "step by step, week by week"
- previous iteration worked and looked like [this](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/iconix/rc-natureofcode/blob/4bbeabf3186f5e917fc9ea2bf48e2e943da31068/echosystem/index.html). now, my ghost guy (lil booya) _accelerates_ towards the mouse (think: some supernatural energy source) when the mouse is on the p5.js canvas. lil booya still maintains his random pop ups and floating movements.
- the book [mentions](https://natureofcode.com/vectors/#example-110-accelerating-toward-the-mouse) that in later chapters, we'll 'fix' the behavior of overshooting the target and thus kind of, like, circling the mouse instead of ever arriving. however this behavior is def a feature not a bug here!
