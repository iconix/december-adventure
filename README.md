# december adventure 2024

trying this https://eli.li/december-adventure concept, as found in a [hacker news comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42288283). wanna use it as a low stakes alternative to advent of code!

goal is simply to "write a little bit of code everyday" in december

each day's folder should contain a README that serves as an adventure log üèûÔ∏è

recurring guest stars:
1. [recurse center](https://www.recurse.com/), or recurse, or rc: a programming retreat that i am doing from early nov 2024 to mid february 2025. i am a part of the winter 1, 2024 (or w1'24) "batch"
2. [the nature of code](https://natureofcode.com/): a book about simulating natural and physical phenomena with code. while at recurse center, i joined a book club and have been working through the material at my own pace
