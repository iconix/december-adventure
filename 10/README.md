## adventure 10: visualize days left (and days spent) at rc

- today, i took some angst and channeled it into code. i deployed a small viz called `days left at rc`: my relationship with time is so strange right now at the recurse center, as i am hyper-aware of how finite it is because time in batch is sooo finite and so fun. i wanted to capture this in some way.
- as noted on the page, this is basically a modified, rc-flavored version of [day by day](https://days.rory.codes/) by rory flint, which was inspired by [your life in weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) from wait but why.
- since whipping it up, i keep it open in a tab and find myself looking at it every so often... it is unnerving at times, comforting at other times
