## adventure 02: add element (acceleration) from _the nature of code_ chapter 1 to my echosystem

- today, i am continuing with my 'ec(h)osystem' project started for a [recurse center](https://www.recurse.com/) book club (w1'24 batch)
- the 'ecosystem project' from [the nature of code](https://natureofcode.com/) book involves creating a simulation of a digital ecosystem where computational creatures interact in a virtual environment. the project encourages students to apply various concepts learned throughout the book to develop a complex, interactive system - "step by step, week by week"
